While previous editions of the TTK tutorial (2018 to 2022) were organized as mini-symposia (focused on the descriptions of TTK’s latest features), this year, in contrast, we would like to organize a very basic beginner’s hands-on tutorial. Specifically, the goal of this tutorial is to accompany attendees in the installation of TTK on their laptop as well as in the running of a few basic examples, all in a very beginner-friendly step-by-step description. This decision is motivated by attendee feedback which we collected at previous editions of the TTK tutorial. We address this feedback in this tutorial proposal. Then, for the first time, beginners would be able to come to the tutorial without prior TTK experience, and walk out with TTK installed on their system, capable of running a few examples and ready to go further. We believe this basic hands-on tutorial will facilitate the adoption of TTK and topological techniques to a broader audience. The tutorial will be organized as follows. The first hands-on exercise will be dedicated to the installation of TTK. The second hands-on exercise will be focused on ParaView’s basic usage. The following three hands-on exercises will be dedicated to the step-by-step replication of three examples extracted from TTK’s online example database (vortex extraction in fluid dynamics, Morse-Smale complex extraction in quantum chemistry and merge tree comparison in ensemble data).

The applications of NLP for supporting various aspects of the visual analysis workflow include helping readers take away key information from charts or dashboards, supporting interaction modalities that help people naturally "ask" questions of their data, generating data summaries and insight reports, and exploring ways to enrich the semantics of data, among others. With data-driven communication being more important than ever, how do we treat text and language as first-class citizens in helping people see and understand data? How do we couple language and charts to make the data more accessible to a variety of audiences with different needs, capabilities, and skills? As the field of NLP matures, computers now have an increased capability of interpreting language and engaging in conversations with people. But can NLP techniques and interactive visualizations work in concert to support an analytical conversation? As the platforms and channels for exploring data go beyond the desktop to chat interfaces, augmented and virtual reality environments, mobile, and large displays, how do we better understand user intent, modalities, and context to make these interactions more delightful and meaningful?
Addressing these questions calls for research at the intersection of human-computer interaction, information visualization, and NLP, three fields with natural synergies but rather infrequent meetings. This workshop will assemble an interdisciplinary community that promotes collaboration across these fields, explore research opportunities and challenges, and continue to establish an agenda for NLP research specifically for data visualization.`,website:"https://www.nlvizworkshop2023.com/"}]},{type:U,title:"Demystifying Color in Your Data Visualizations",start:1400,end:1700,venue:ce,items:[{organizers:"Theresa-Marie Rhyne",description:`This tutorial provides an overview of the basics of color theory while exploring various color mysteries. New to 2023, we show how to use Adobe’s Firefly, a creative generative AI model in Beta, to expand your data color scheme choices. You also learn how to build your own colormaps by transforming color harmonies. Several puzzling notions are examined. These include but are not limited to discovering that Magenta is not a spectral color, merging Red and Green lights results in Yellow, and most Blues in Data Visualizations turn out to be Cyan-Blue combinations. The course is intended for a broad audience of individuals interested in understanding, applying, and building color schemes for data visualization.
With a five stage colorization process, you learn how to build and select a data color scheme with color harmony, incorporate color models concepts and address color deficiency. You discover the differences between mixing colors in perceptual, display, printer, and traditional painter color spaces. For example, you learn how to transition from Red as a primary hue in RGB display space to Red as a secondary combination of Magenta and Yellow in CMYK printer space. You explore online and mobile color apps, like Adobe Firefly, and HCL Wizard, to help with continued colorization. Many of these tools are freely available. Along the way, color vision principles, perceptual uniformity with the Hue Chroma Luminance (HCL) model as well as color gamut, spaces and systems are examined. Concepts like extending the fundamentals of the Bauhaus into digital media , the Rainbow colormap dilemma, and overviews of appearance principals are covered.

This venue will once again provide an avenue for surfacing creative or critical work that would otherwise not find a home through the standard VIS conference review process.",website:"https://altvis.github.io/"}]},{type:ye,title:"SciVis Contest",start:1400,end:1700,venue:ce,items:[{organizers:"Tim Gerrits, Divya Banesh",website:"https://sciviscontest2023.github.io/"}]}]},{date:"Oct. 24, 2023",day:"Tuesday",events:[{type:_,title:"VIS Welcome",start:845,end:900,venue:ee,items:[]},{type:_,title:"VGTC Awards",start:900,end:945,venue:ee,items:[]},{type:_,title:"Test of Time Awards",start:945,end:1030,venue:ee,items:[]},{type:X,title:"Coffee Break",start:1030,end:1100,venue:null,items:[]},{type:_,title:"VIS Keynote",start:1100,end:1200,venue:N,items:[{speakers:"Dr. Drew Berry, Anders Ynnerman",title:"Visualizing the Chemistry of Life on giant 360-degree screens",abstract:"Our keynote presentation will take you on a journey through the creative storytelling and technical challenges of bringing multi-scale visualizations to giant-sized fulldome screens. Our immersive 360-degree film, 'Chemistry of Life', launched in 2023, presents an ultra-high resolution stereo 8K experience that explores the life around us from what we experience every day to the hidden microscopic realms of the molecular. The production takes you on a journey into your inner universe, combining advanced scientific visualizations to bring you into the dynamic, molecular world we all carry within us. We explore the powerhouses of cells, mitochondria, and learn how chemical processes connect us to all other life forms on Earth. Throughout this presentation, we will discuss the technical and artistic challenges we faced, as well as the scientific research that informed our approach. Our hope is that this film will inspire a deeper appreciation for the world around us and encourage us all to continue exploring and learning about the mysteries of our universe."}]},{type:X,title:"Lunch Break",start:1200,end:1400,venue:null,items:[]},{type:_,title:"VIS Opening",start:1400,end:1420,venue:ee,items:[]},{type:_,title:"ACC Summary",start:1420,end:1430,venue:ee,items:[]},{type:_,title:"Best Papers 1",start:1430,end:1510,venue:ee,items:[{chair:"Michael Wybrow"},{authors:"Xingyu Lan, Yanqiu Wu, Nan Cao",title:"Affective Visualization Design: Leveraging the Emotional Impact of Data"},{authors:"Max Piochowiak, Carsten Dachsbacher",title:"Fast Compressed Segmentation Volumes for Scientific Visualization"},{authors:"Fumeng Yang, Mandi Cai, Chloe Rose Mortenson, Hoda Fakhari, Ayse Deniz Lokmanoglu, Jessica Hullman, Steven Franconeri, Nicholas Diakopoulos, Erik Nisbet, Matthew Kay",title:"Swaying the Public?

For about 20 years, VA was one of three pillars in the interactive data analysis and visualization (VIS) community. Generation after generation, the VA community has evolved its understanding of research problems and, along the way, contributed various techniques, applications, and research methods. While some developed techniques have stood the test of time, we will consider what else needs to be remembered or even revitalized from the good old days in this panel. Further, VA is currently facing exciting times, with great changes and trends within and outside the community. In this panel, we want to analyze current research trends in VA and discuss our most exciting ideas and directions. Looking ahead, it can already be anticipated that the future of VA is subject to change. Following productive and successful panels at EuroVA 2023 and EuroVis 2023, in this panel, we want to continue mapping out future research directions for our community, with an emphasis on VA. Along the lines of the past, the present, and the future of VA, the guiding theme of our interactive panel will be three types of (provoking) statements: (i) In the good old days, I liked when we did … (ii) Currently, a most exciting trend is … & (iii) In the future, we will be doing … Come and join us to reflect on past and present trends, daring a look ahead to an exciting future for the interactive data analysis and visualization community!"}]},{type:te,title:"VISAP Session 1",start:1045,end:1200,venue:O,items:[{website:"https://visap.net/2023"}]},{type:ke,title:"CG&A: Systems, Techniques, and Applications",start:1045,end:1200,venue:Y,items:[{chair:"Alexander Lex"},{title:"Giga Graph Cities: Their Buckets, Buildings, Waves, and Fragments",authors:"James Abello, Haoyang Zhang, Daniel Nakhimovich, Chengguizi Han, Mridul Aanjaneya"},{title:"Narrative In Situ Visual Analysis for Large-Scale Ocean Eddy Evolution",authors:"Xiaoyang Han, Xiaomin Yu, Guan Li, Jun Liu, Ying Zhao, Guihua Shan"},{title:"Technology Trends and Challenges for Large-Scale Scientific Visualization",authors:"James Ahrens"},{title:"SUBPLEX: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand Local Model Explanations at the Subpopulation Level",authors:"Jun Yuan, Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan, Brian Barr, Kyle Overton, Kim Rees, Luis Gustavo Nonato, Enrico Bertini, Claudio Silva"},{title:"A Multiscale Geospatial Dataset and an Interactive Visualization Dashboard for Computational Epidemiology and Open Scientific Research",authors:`Muhammad Usman, Honglu Zhou, Seonghyeon Moon, Xun Zhang, Petros Faloutsos, Mubbasir Kapadia

To allow for comprehensive analysis and comparison of the generated data, the ultimate goal is to construct an atlas of the human body that characterizes the cell types, tissue structures, and abundance of different types of biomolecules across these structures. The data supporting these atlas efforts, however, is creating challenging visualization problems due to 1) the dimensionality and density of the data and 2) the multi-modal measurements (including proteins, genes, and metabolites) associated with these structures in both 2D images and 3D volumes. Additionally, many datasets routinely include tens of thousands to millions of cells, with up to thousands of measurements per cell, resulting in critical scalability challenges.
This new paradigm of tissue atlas construction presents many relevant visualization challenges that will require the visualization community’s expertise to address. Due to the inherent anatomical nature of the data, biologists need to interact with this data in spatial and hierarchical contexts using visualization systems that are able to handle multi-modal visualization and queries at scale. Particularly in the context of diseases, visualizations are required to allow for comparisons of normal vs. disease, context of other biomedical information, display of uncertainty, and tools for education and training. Some of these visualization efforts have already been applied to cancer and kidney disease and are having impacts on research in human health.
We aim to identify future avenues of visualization research that can be helpful for exploring and analyzing data within these cell atlases. Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) offer potential for navigation and data analysis in 3D, but require careful consideration of useful techniques for users. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are being employed and will require explainable/interpretable visualization techniques. We plan to focus part of the panel discussion on the advantages and opportunities of employing these visualization technologies to aid in our understanding of human biology and aim to identify worthwhile future directions for visualization research to target.`},{title:"HuBMAP and related Cell Atlas efforts",speakers:"Ajay Pillai"},{title:"Vitessce: Visual integration tool for exploration of spatial single-cell experiments",speakers:"Mark Keller"},{title:"3D structural biology data",speakers:"Barbora Kozlíková"},{title:"Volumetric Rendering of Medical Imaging data and how to translate it in AR/VR",speakers:"Stefan Bruckner"},{title:"Panel Q&A",moderators:"Nils Gehlenborg, Morgan Turner"},{title:"Closing",speakers:"Eric Moerth"}]},{type:te,title:"VISAP Session 2",start:1045,end:1200,venue:O,items:[{website:"https://visap.net/2023"}]},{type:ne,title:"Applications / Design",start:1045,end:1200,venue:Y,items:[{chair:"Panagiotis D.

Visualization for machine learning (VIS4ML) has been a thriving research area within the visualization community because of the need for better affordances and representations to enable broad groups of stakeholders to interact with and interpret machine learning models. However, recent advancements in AI are changing our understanding of the capabilities of machine learning models, both in performance and in their ability to interact with the general population. In the light of these advancements, we feel it is an important time for the visualization community to consider how the opportunities for visualization have changed. We have gathered a diverse set of panelists from both academia and industry, with varying levels of experience. We hope that providing a multitude of perspectives will shed light on new opportunities for visualization research, while providing context on the natural evolution of the field over the last few decades. The panel format will begin with introductory statements from each panelists. Then, through a set of open ended questions, we will ask panelists to have an open discussion about which types of stakeholders, use cases, and steps of the modeling pipeline they expect to change the most. The panel will conclude by asking each panelist to share where they feel the best opportunities are for VIS4ML research in the medium term future."}]},{type:E,title:"Time Series Data",start:1545,end:1700,venue:Y,items:[{chair:"Silvia Miksch"},{title:"DOMINO: Visual Causal Reasoning with Time-Dependent Phenomena",authors:"Jun Wang, Klaus Mueller"},{title:"Attribute-Aware RBFs: Interactive Visualization of Time Series Particle Volumes Using RT Core Range Queries",authors:"Nate Morrical, Stefan Zellmann, Alper Sahistan, Patrick Shriwise, Valerio Pascucci"},{title:"Reclaiming the Horizon: Novel Visualization Designs for Time-Series Data with Large Value Ranges",authors:"Daniel Braun, Rita Borgo, Max Sondag, Tatiana von Landesberger"},{title:"Supporting Guided Exploratory Visual Analysis on Time Series Data with Reinforcement Learning",authors:"Yang Shi, Bingchang Chen, Ying Chen, Zhuochen Jin, Ke Xu, Xiaohan Jiao, Tian Gao, Nan Cao"},{title:"TimeTuner: Diagnosing Time Representations for Time-Series Forecasting with Counterfactual Explanations",authors:"Jianing Hao, Qing Shi, Yilin Ye, Wei Zeng"},{title:"Visualizing Large-Scale Spatial Time Series with GeoChron",authors:`Zikun Deng, Shifu Chen, Tobias Schreck, Dazhen Deng, Tan Tang, Mingliang Xu, Di Weng, Yingcai Wu

On the other, maps are a basic tool for information visualization in almost every academic and professional discipline that analyzes data related to geographic location. Indeed, even GI scientists have a complex relationship with maps---at times cherished touchstone; at others atavistic constraint. This capstone uses the map---perhaps the ultimate interdisciplinary artefact---as a lens to reflect on essential research themes in GI science, and on the nature of interdisciplinary research into geovisualization. The analysis identifies five "special" features of geographic information, including its structure, dynamism, uncertainty, and its intimate connection with human cognition, that directly impact on mapping and geovisualization. The examples highlight the importance of knowledge exchange in an interdisciplinary field like GI science, and particularly of exchange with the visualization community. The conclusions also look to the future, and identify some of the most promising emerging problem domains in GI science.'}]},{type:_,title:"VIS Closing",start:1145,end:1200,venue:Ce,items:[]}]}].map(o=>{let e={date:o.date,day:o.day};return e.events=o.events.map(a=>{let t={type:a.type,title:a.title,start:a.start,end:a.end,venue:a.venue,id:a.type+"---"+a.title,items:a.items};return t.start_time=De(t.start),t.end_time=De(t.end),t.duration=Oe(t.start_time,t.end_time),t.datetime=e.day+", "+e.date+" "+t.start_time+" AEDT (UTC+11)",t}),e});function De(o){let e=o%100,a=Math.floor(o/100),t=a>=12?"PM":"AM";return a>12&&(a=a-12),a=a.toString(),e==0?e="00":e<10?e="0"+e:e=e.toString(),a+":"+e+" "+t}function Oe(o,e){let a=new Date("0 "+o),i=(new Date("0 "+e)-a)/1e3/60,n=Math.floor(i/60),s=i-n*60;return{minutes:i,expr:n.toString()+":"+s.toString()}}function Ue(){return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("bookmarks")||"[]")}function je(o){localStorage.setItem("bookmarks",JSON.stringify(o||[]))}function Me(o,e,a){const t=o.slice();return t[6]=e[a],t}function Te(o){let e,a,t=o[3][o[6]]+"",i,n,s;function r(l,h){return l[6]==="website"?ei:l[6]==="description"?$e:Qe}let g=r(o)(o);return{c(){e=A("div"),a=A("span"),i=R(t),n=H(),g.c(),s=H(),this.h()},l(l){e=C(l,"DIV",{class:!0});var h=P(e);a=C(h,"SPAN",{class:!0});var k=P(a);i=I(k,t),k.forEach(m),n=W(h),g.l(h),s=W(h),h.forEach(m),this.h()},h(){S(a,"class",Q("name "+o[6])+" svelte-1n04qcp"),S(e,"class","item svelte-1n04qcp")},m(l,h){T(l,e,h),y(e,a),y(a,i),y(e,n),g.m(e,null),y(e,s)},p(l,h){g.p(l,h)},d(l){l&&m(e),g.d()}}}function Qe(o){let e,a=o[0][o[6]]+"",t;return{c(){e=A("p"),t=R(a),this.h()},l(i){e=C(i,"P",{class:!0});var n=P(e);t=I(n,a),n.forEach(m),this.h()},h(){S(e,"class",Q("content "+o[6])+" svelte-1n04qcp")},m(i,n){T(i,e,n),y(e,t)},p(i,n){n&1&&a!==(a=i[0][i[6]]+"")&&x(t,a)},d(i){i&&m(e)}}}function $e(o){let e;function a(n,s){return n[0][n[6]].length>100?ai:ii}let t=a(o),i=t(o);return{c(){i.c(),e=Z()},l(n){i.l(n),e=Z()},m(n,s){i.m(n,s),T(n,e,s)},p(n,s){t===(t=a(n))&&i?i.p(n,s):(i.d(1),i=t(n),i&&(i.c(),i.m(e.parentNode,e)))},d(n){n&&m(e),i.d(n)}}}function ei(o){let e,a=o[0][o[6]]+"",t,i;return{c(){e=A("a"),t=R(a),this.h()},l(n){e=C(n,"A",{class:!0,href:!0,target:!0});var s=P(e);t=I(s,a),s.forEach(m),this.h()},h(){S(e,"class",Q("content "+o[6])+" svelte-1n04qcp"),S(e,"href",i=o[0][o[6]]),S(e,"target","_blank")},m(n,s){T(n,e,s),y(e,t)},p(n,s){s&1&&a!==(a=n[0][n[6]]+"")&&x(t,a),s&1&&i!==(i=n[0][n[6]])&&S(e,"href",i)},d(n){n&&m(e)}}}function ii(o){let e,a=o[0][o[6]]+"",t;return{c(){e=A("p"),t=R(a),this.h()},l(i){e=C(i,"P",{class:!0});var n=P(e);t=I(n,a),n.forEach(m),this.h()},h(){S(e,"class",Q("content "+o[6])+" svelte-1n04qcp")},m(i,n){T(i,e,n),y(e,t)},p(i,n){n&1&&a!==(a=i[0][i[6]]+"")&&x(t,a)},d(i){i&&m(e)}}}function ai(o){let e;function a(n,s){return n[1][n[6]]?ti:ni}let t=a(o),i=t(o);return{c(){i.c(),e=Z()},l(n){i.l(n),e=Z()},m(n,s){i.m(n,s),T(n,e,s)},p(n,s){t===(t=a(n))&&i?i.p(n,s):(i.d(1),i=t(n),i&&(i.c(),i.m(e.parentNode,e)))},d(n){n&&m(e),i.d(n)}}}function ti(o){let e,a=o[0][o[6]]+"",t,i,n,s="Hide",r,c;function g(){return o[5](o[6])}return{c(){e=A("p"),t=R(a),i=H(),n=A("button"),n.textContent=s,this.h()},l(l){e=C(l,"P",{class:!0});var h=P(e);t=I(h,a),i=W(h),n=C(h,"BUTTON",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),j(n)!=="svelte-1nyvtn"&&(n.textContent=s),h.forEach(m),this.h()},h(){S(n,"class","show-full svelte-1n04qcp"),S(e,"class",Q("content "+o[6])+" svelte-1n04qcp")},m(l,h){T(l,e,h),y(e,t),y(e,i),y(e,n),r||(c=ie(n,"click",g),r=!0)},p(l,h){o=l,h&1&&a!==(a=o[0][o[6]]+"")&&x(t,a)},d(l){l&&m(e),r=!1,c()}}}function ni(o){let e,a=o[0][o[6]].substring(0,100)+"",t,i,n,s="Show",r,c;function g(){return o[4](o[6])}return{c(){e=A("p"),t=R(a),i=R(`...
